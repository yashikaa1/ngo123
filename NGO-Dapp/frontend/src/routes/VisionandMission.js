                Established in 2007, Educate Girls is a non-profit that focusses on mobilising communities for girls’ education in India’s rural and educationally backward areas.

            Educate Girls currently operates successfully in over 21,000+ villages in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. By leveraging the Government’s existing investment in schools and by engaging with a huge base of community volunteers, Educate Girls helps to identify, enrol and retain out-of-school girls and to improve foundational skills in literacy and numeracy for all children (both girls and boys). This helps deliver measurable results to a large number of children and avoids parallel delivery of services.
